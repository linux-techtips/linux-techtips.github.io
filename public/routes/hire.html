  <span>></span>Awesome!!! I'm working my hardest to break into the industry
  wherever it may have me. Even though I've only done it part-time, programming
  hardly feels like a job. I do it because I love it and I want to be the best I
  can possibly be. If you're interested, feel free to contact me using any of
  the links below. If not I can always go for my masters I suppose...
