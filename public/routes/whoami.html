  I'm a programmer obsessed with the joy of programming. I am currently
  attending <a href="https://www.utrgv.edu/">UTRGV</a> with a major in Computer
  Science and a minor in Cyber Security.
</p>
<p>
  <span>></span>
  My primary obsession is programming language design and compiler development.
  I like staying on top of the latest practices and designs for programming
  languages and one day hope to create my own.
</p>
<p>

  Even though I like to hang out on the low-level side of development in
  languages like: <a href="https://isocpp.org/">C++</a>,
  <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, and
  <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. With the projects or jobs that
  I take on, I always enjoy adapting to widly different areas of programming
  that I would have never approached otherwise.
