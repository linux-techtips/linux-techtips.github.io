  I'm a programmer obsessed with the joy of programming. I am currently
  attending <a href="https://www.utrgv.edu/csci/" target="_blank">UTRGV</a> with
  a major in Computer Science and a minor in Cyber Security.
</p>
<p>
  <span>></span>
  My primary obsession is programming language design and compiler development.
  I like staying on top of the latest practices and designs for programming
  languages and one day hope to create my own.
</p>
<p>
  <span>></span>
  Even though I like to hang out on the low-level side of development in
  languages like: <a href="https://isocpp.org/" target="_blank">C++</a>,
  <a href="https://ziglang.org/" target="_blank">Zig</a>, and
  <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank">Rust</a>. With the
  projects or jobs that I take on, I always enjoy adapting to widly different
  areas of programming that I would have never approached otherwise.

  <p>
    <span>></span>Awesome!!! I'm working my hardest to break into the industry
    wherever it may have me. Even though I've only done it part-time,
    programming hardly feels like a job. I do it because I love it and I want to
    be the best I can possibly be. If you're interested, feel free to contact me
    using any of the links below. If not I can always go for my masters I
    suppose...
